# PHOSS

PHOSS is an open source Python hyperparameter search simulation platform for
distributed testing of scheduling algorithms.

## Installing from PyPI

To install PHOSS, run
```bash
pip install phoss
```

## Usage

To use PHOSS, just declare an ExperimentGroup with the arguments you want and
call `ExperimentGroup.run()`. This method returns a results object, which can
then be passed in as part of a list to the `ExperimentAnalysis.plot_results()`
method.

We have included two example usage scripts that use PHOSS:
- `test_experiments.py` creates and runs multiple `ExperimentGroup`s and plots
their results using `ExperimentAnalysis`.
- `test_landscaper.py` specifies a normal loss decay landscape and plots the
landscape generated by our simulator.
